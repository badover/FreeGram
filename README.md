**FreeGram** is an open-source web messenger designed for anonymous communication without registration, tracking, or personal data collection.

The server does not log any information about users or their activity.  
FreeGram does not use any database, which means message history is never stored.

## How It Works

FreeGram allows users to create temporary chat rooms using any login and password of their choice.

Room credentials can be securely shared with friends.  
Each room is an isolated and private space where participants can exchange messages in real time.
**In rooms you can send messages, videos, photos, talk with your friends in audio-calls and all this without any logs.**

Rooms are ephemeral and exist only while they are actively used.

## Security

- Protection against XSS attacks  
- Room passwords are stored locally on the server in encrypted form  
- No SQL or other database usage, eliminating SQL injection risks  
- Rooms are automatically deleted after 5 minutes of inactivity  
- Messages are not logged or persisted  
- Messages cannot be correlated with real users

## Vision Statement

Our team believe that every person has right for privacy. Many messengers nowadays don't respect this right: they collect a lot information about you, create your digigtal "passport" and don't care about your safety inside. The idea for this messenger came to me when I saw how the well-known messenger Telegram works: not really caring about the confidentiality of users and their right to privacy. I want to provide a place where anybody can go and talk quietly, without fear that one day a messenger will give out their logs or collect data about them and show personalized ads. No to censorship!
