# FreeGram - https://fgram.net/

**FreeGram** is an open-source web messenger for anonymous communication without registration, tracking, or personal data collection.
Server does not log any information about you or your actions inside. 

**FreeGram** does not have any database which means your history of messages wouldn't be saved.

## How it works?
You can create "rooms" with any login and password and send them to your freinds. Every room is a safe chat where you can share messages with each other.

## Security
Every room protected from any type of xss atatck. Passwords you create for the rooms are saved on sever locally and crypted. 
After 5 minutes without any people room will automatically be deleted. No SQl injection is possible. 
All your messages are safe and it is impossible to correlate any message to you.

## Vision statment
Our team belive that every perosn has right for privacy. Many messengers nowadays don't respect this right: they collect a lot information about you, create your digigtal "passport" and don't care about your safety inside. The idea for this messenger came to me when I saw how the well-known messenger Telegram works: not really caring about the confidentiality of users and their right to privacy. I want to provide a place where anybody can go and talk quietly, without fear that one day a messenger will give out their logs or collect data about them and show personalized ads.
